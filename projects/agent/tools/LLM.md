# LLM Agent Tool Design Guidelines

## Generic vs. Dedicated ORM Tools

This document provides guidelines for developing tools that allow LLMs to interact with Django models through the ORM.

### Comparative Analysis

| Dimension | Generic Approach | Dedicated Approach |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Flexibility** | ✅ Handles any model through a single tool<br>✅ Adapts automatically to model changes | ✅ Tailored to specific model needs<br>❌ Requires manual updates when models change |
| **LLM Usage** | ✅ Consistent interface pattern<br>❌ Requires understanding complex nested structures | ✅ Explicit function names that mirror natural language<br>❌ Many similar functions can confuse the LLM |
| **Extensibility** | ✅ Centralized support for advanced features<br>❌ Complex payloads may be difficult for LLM to construct | ✅ Can implement specialized query patterns<br>❌ Proliferation of similar tools for each pattern |
| **Efficiency** | ✅ Centralizes optimization opportunities<br>❌ May use less efficient general-purpose code | ✅ Highly tailored query optimization<br>❌ Optimization must be replicated across tools |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ Single code path to maintain<br>❌ Changes might affect all models | ✅ Isolated changes per model<br>❌ Higher overall maintenance burden |

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Strategy

Use a **hybrid approach** that leverages the strengths of both methods:

1. **Generic ORM Tool as Foundation**
   - Use for common CRUD operations across all models
   - Handles basic filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Automatically adapts to model changes

2. **Specialized Tools for Complex Cases**
   - Implement dedicated tools only for:
     - Complex queries with multiple joins or aggregations
     - Performance-critical operations requiring specific optimizations
     - Operations with complex business logic or validations

## Implementation Guidelines

### For the Generic Tool

- Ensure the generic tool includes options for:
  - `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to optimize queries
  - Support for basic annotations and aggregations
  - `values_only` parameter to control serialization depth
  - Consistent error handling and permission checks

### For Specialized Tools

- Only create dedicated tools when:
  - The query is too complex to express through the generic interface
  - The operation requires specific optimizations for performance
  - The business logic cannot be generalized
  - The operation is frequently used and benefits from a simpler interface

### Documentation for LLM

- Clearly document all available models and their relationships
- Provide examples of common queries using both generic and dedicated tools
- Include "recipes" for constructing complex queries with the generic tool
- Maintain a concise list of specialized tools with their specific purposes

## Example Decision Process

When adding a new feature:

1. **Can it be handled by the generic ORM tool?**
   - If yes → Use the generic tool
   - If no → Continue to step 2

2. **Is it a one-off or infrequent operation?**
   - If yes → Use raw SQL or custom Django ORM in the view/API and don't expose to LLM
   - If no → Continue to step 3

3. **Will it be frequently used or is it performance-critical?**
   - If yes → Create a specialized tool with optimized implementation
   - If no → Extend the generic tool to handle this case if possible

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize Consistency**: Use similar patterns for similar operations
2. **Optimize for LLM Understanding**: Clear naming and documentation helps the LLM select the right tool
3. **Monitor LLM Tool Usage**: Track which tools are most used and optimize accordingly
4. **Balance Performance and Maintainability**: Don't prematurely optimize with specialized tools
5. **Test LLM Tool Selection**: Verify the LLM can correctly choose between generic and specialized tools

By following these guidelines, you'll create a system that's both maintainable and efficient, while providing the LLM with a clear interface for interacting with your Django models.
